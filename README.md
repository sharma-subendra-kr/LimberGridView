## Current version LimberGridView 1.0.0-beta.14.

LimberGridView, a powerful JavaScript Library using Computational Geometry to render movable, dynamically resizable, and auto-arranging grids. Written in vanilla JavaScript, it can be plugged into most frameworks, plus it has a plugin for React applications. It gives users the most optimal arrangements using its highly efficient and fine-tuned algorithm.

## This is a beta release. This version might be unstable.
Although many issues were identified and resolved in this current release, you might sometimes encounter unusual behavior.

### Improvements in the arrange algorithm are made in patches. I try to make sure it doesn't affect any APIs.

## Features:
* Built-in Intersection Observed
* Built-in Resize Observer
* Undo-Redo
* Touch support for tablets
* Mobile view
* Plugins for React. LimberGridView has "renderPlugin" and "removePlugin", these are callbacks, that pass the element which is the item itself. ReactDOM.render and ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode should be called in "renderPlugin" and "removePlugin" respectively.

### LimberGridView is free software (Free as in freedom, not the price). If you like to use this library on non-free software, you can get a proprietary license. To get a proprietary license, [pre-order now](https://limber.in/LimberGridView/buy).

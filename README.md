* **Complete Rewrite from 0.0.0**
* **renderPlugin and removePlugin, these callbacks help you to render React JSX inside any item. (These might help in someother framework as well. I haven't used other frameworks.)**

###### Features to watch out for in the next releases. ######
* **Built in Intersection Observer**
* **Undo and Redo**

**I am constantly trying to improve the arranging algorithm and this will be done in patches.**
